# LeetCode
I recently started to code my LeetCode tasks in Intellij to get some proper IDE features. <br>
Additionally, for a better learning experience and to make it easier to understand old LeetCode problems, I decided to create a Github repository to upload my solutions. 
These always include my personal solution and I will also try to include an optimized solution as well - mainly for me to check how I can improve.
